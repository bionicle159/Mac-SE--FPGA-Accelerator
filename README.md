# Mac-SE--FPGA-Accelerator
A repository to discuss ideas of a new accelerator for the Mac SE and SE/30.


29/11/2020: Starting this repository as a place to discuss ideas of a new accelerator for the SE Macs, this is inspired by the Apollo Vampire accelerator for the Commodore Amiga series. 
This is a community focused project that hopes to create a modern solution that can replace aging and increasingly collectable accelerators with an affordable and open design that can be modified and adapted by anyone.

Ideally, existing designs for Mac SE accelerators will form the basis of what kind of design the FPGA board would use. An example of one that only changes the processor would be the 68020 expansion by Radius that, unlike the modern Vampire V4, still relies on the original memory slots on the SE board.

Another idea would be one that overhalls the system ROM for the SE, adding more functionality that would not be available to the original 1987 machine. Ideas to consider include  1.4mb Floppy capability, being able to boot from a ROM or RAM disk, a separate memory section to get around the 4mb limit of the original SE, and IDE or SD card storage for more affordable hard drive options.

I hope this will spark interest in the Classic Mac community and help to bring together developers and programmers, looking to breathe new life into these aging machines with performance upgrades and quality of life improvements that rival 68k communities have enjoyed for years.
